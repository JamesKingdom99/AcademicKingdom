This is a python django project. 

It is a basic blog format website. Te idea behind it is to make a space that people can easily post lesson plans on any topic they want 
to and have people able to easily interact. 

Some simple components of the website are video, which needs just the embed source.
Links that connect for a wiki, would like to intergrate one into the site. 
Link for vocabulary, I like to use quizlet, working on creating a fully ineractive part. 
Learning targets, State Standards, guiding question, back ground and perormance task. 
Quiz - whick I would say link a google form to, but am working on making a build you own quiz. 

All help on this project will be apprieciated. 

Best!
